Zombie Defense
==============

Zombie defense XNA 4.0 game

Developed using Visual Studio 2010 and XNA 4.0

Objective:
==========
Prevent the zombies from attacking the mother brain. Money is awarded for killing zombies that can be used to purchase 
towers, mines, barricades, and air strikes. 

Click and hold on your entities (or mother brain) to repair or upgrade them. 
Towers develop a larger target radius as you heal them.

To add an item to the playing field, simply click and drag it to the location on the field where you want it placed. 
Items cannot be dropped onto other entities. 
Right click a dropped entity to delete it.

Zombies spawn at regular intervals. Zombies that are killed will respawn in addition to the regularly spawning zombies. 
This creates an interesting swarm affect after a wide area kill by an air strike.

Towers - target zombies within view radius. Can shoot over barricades. Can be upgraded to add hit points and a larger scan area.

Mortar towers - target zombies within view radius. Cannot shoot over barricades. Can be upgraded to add hit points and a larger scan area. Explosions can damage barricades, towers, and mother brain. 

NOTE: Towers and mortar towers loose health as they fire and must be healed up again.

Mines - Explode when touched by a zombie. Cannot be upgraded. Can damage barricades, towers, and mother brain.

Barricades - Take damage from zombies. Used to block access to protected items. Can be upgraded.

Air strikes - Scatter bombs a selected area. Cannot be upgraded. Can damage barricades, towers, and mother brain.

Zombies - We love to hate these guys. All the want to do is run straight for the brain and claw through whatever lies between them and the sweet nectar of grey matter. Zombies spawn with a random amount of hit points. The fast and feisty ones tend to be weaker. The slow lumbering ones can do some serious damage if not dealt with promptly.

How to play:
============
Protect the brain from the zombies by placing barricades in the path of the heard. Erect lazer towers and mortar towers to shoot at zombies. 

Mines will detonate when a zombie touches it.

Summon an air strike to kill a large number of zombies at once. 

Heal towers and walls by holding down the mouse button over the object.

Drag items into the playing area to use them to defend the brain. You must have enough credits and quota must be met for items to become available. 

Press "P" to pause the game. As an added bonus, you can continue to place towers and heal defences while the zombies stand around.

Press "R" to reset the game.

Press "F" to toggle full screen.

Press "D" (debug) to see the bounding rectangles of on screen entities as well as their target areas.


Requirements:
=============
A love for zombies and silly games with bad graphics

Purpose:
========
This started out as an office challenge that spawned into a mini game of sorts...

A simple little game that can distract your attention from the mondane world where zombies are not yet a threat. 
Could also serve as a training simulator for the upcoming zombie apocolypse.
