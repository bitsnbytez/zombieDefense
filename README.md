Zombie defense XNA 4.0 game

Developed using Visual Studio 2010 and XNA 4.0

Objective:
==========
Prevent the zombies from attacking the mother brain. Money is awarded for killing zombies that can be used to purchase 
towers, mines, barricades, and air strikes. 

Click and hold on your entities (or mother brain) to repair or upgrade them. 
Towers develop a larger target radius as you heal them.

To add an item to the playing field, simply click and drag it to the location on the field where you want it placed. 
Items cannot be dropped onto other entities. 
Right click a dropped entity to delete it.

Zombies spawn at regular intervals. Zombies that are killed will respawn in addition to the regularly spawning zombies. 
This creates an interesting swarm affect after a wide area kill by an air strike.

Towers - target zombies within view radius. Can shoot over barricades. Can be upgraded to add hit points and a larger scan area.

Mortar towers - target zombies within view radius. Cannot shoot over barricades. Can be upgraded to add hit points and a larger scan area. Explosions can damage barricades, towers, and mother brain. 

NOTE: Towers and mortar towers loose health as they fire and must be healed up again.

Mines - Explode when touched by a zombie. Cannot be upgraded. Can damage barricades, towers, and mother brain.

Barricades - Take damage from zombies. Used to block access to protected items. Can be upgraded.

Air strikes - Scatter bombs a selected area. Cannot be upgraded. Can damage barricades, towers, and mother brain.
